# EliDupree Projects Manager

A tool for organizing upcoming tasks on Eli Dupree projects.

Primarily intended for my personal use, but it might eventually develop into something that could also be useful for others. At the time of this writing, it isn't complete or useful yet. If and when it eventually becomes useful, I'll try to update this README to reflect that. Until then, there's nothing much to see here for non-EliDuprees.

I made this require HTTPS for security reasons, and used [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate a local root CA; on Windows, the root cert went in `~/AppData/Local/mkcert` (noting this because in my case, I also needed to share the root cert with my other devices).
